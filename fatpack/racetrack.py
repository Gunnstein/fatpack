    """Racetrack filter for accelerated fatigue testing.

    The racetrack amplitude filter removes low amplitude cycles from
    the reversals without altering the sequence of the remaining
    cycles. The racetrack filter therefore allows to accelerate
    variable amplitude fatigue testing by removing low amplitude
    cycles which does not significantly affect the overall fatigue
    damage and at the same time preserves sequence effects inherent in
    the original sequence.

    Arguments
    ---------
    reversals : 1darray
        An 1D-array of reversals.
    h : float
        Racetrack width, cycles with range lower than width are
        filtered out.

    Returns
    -------
    signal : 1darray
        Signal after applying racetrack filter.
    indices : 1darray
        Indices of racetrack filtered signal.

    The data points in the dataseries `y` are classified into `k`

    the successive extremas of the dataseries `y`. The reversals are
    then filtered with the racetrack amplitude filter and then
    peak-valley filtered again to find the racetrack filtered
    reversals.

    ---------
    y : 1darray
        Dataseries containing the signal to find the reversals for.
    h : float
        Racetrack width, cycles with range lower than width are
        filtered out.
    k : int
        The number of intervals to divide the min-max range of the
        dataseries into.

    Returns
    -------
    reversals : 1darray
        Reversals of the initial data series `y` after racetrack
        filtering.
    indices : 1darray
